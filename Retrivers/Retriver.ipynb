When India gained independence in 1947, few Indians had experience in making or conducting foreign policy. However, the country\\'s oldest political party, the Indian National Congress, had established a small foreign department in 1925 to make overseas contacts and to publicise its independence struggle. From the late 1920s on, Jawaharlal Nehru, who had a long-standing interest in world affairs among independence leaders, formulated the Congress\\'s stance on international issues in tandem with V. K. Krishna Menon; after 1947, they articulated India\\'s worldview as Prime Minister and de facto Foreign Minister.\\nIndia\\'s international influence varied over the years after independence. Indian prestige and moral authority were high in the 1950s and facilitated the acquisition of developmental assistance from both East and West. Although the prestige stemmed from India\\'s nonaligned stance, and in particular the position it placed Indian diplomats, like Menon, to mediate or conciliate in others\\' disputes, the nation was unable to prevent Cold War politics from becoming intertwined with interstate relations in South Asia.  On the intensely debated Kashmir issue with Pakistan, India lost credibility by rejecting United Nations\\' calls for a plebiscite in the disputed area.\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, India\\'s international position among developed and developing countries faded during wars with China and Pakistan, disputes with other countries in South Asia, and India\\'s attempt to match Pakistan\\'s support from the United States and China by signing the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in August 1971.

India has thus consistently supported the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to a State and the consequent imperative need for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region based on United Nations Security Council resolution 242, 338 and 425, as well as the principle of \"Land for Peace.\" India has also supported the Madrid Conference of October, 1991.\\nIndia participated in the 2007 Annapolis Conference and the consequent donors conference. India\\'s government noted the direct relevance for India on the issue and favoured the creation of \"sovereign, independent, united states of Palestine\" asserting that its support for the cause remains unwavered.

Abbas laid the foundation stone of the chancery-cum-residence complex of the embassy of Palestine, where the PAP Abbas formally dedicated the building to the people of Palestine from the people of India. The gift underscored India\\'s \"unwavering solidarity and commitment to an independent Palestine\" and was seen by some to balance its growing relations with Israel.
